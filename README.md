# *Credit Risk With Supervised Machine Learning*

## *Project Overview*

Fast lending, lending service company want to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Management believes that machine learning will do more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lend to lower default rates.

The company wants Ali to  assist the lead data scientist in implementing this plan. I n this role Ali will build and evaluate several machine learning models or algorithms to predict credit risk. Ali will use techniques such as re sampling ans boosting to make most of his models and the data.

One he designs and implements these algorithms Ali will evaluate their performance and see hoe well the models predict data.
