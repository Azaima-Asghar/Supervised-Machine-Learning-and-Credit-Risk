# *Credit Risk With Supervised Machine Learning*

## *Project Overview*

Fast lending, lending service company want to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Managment believes that machine learning will do more accdurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lend to lower default rates.

The company wants Ali assist the lead data sicentist in implementing this plan. I n thid role Ali will build and evaluate several machine learning models or alogorithms to preditc cerdit risk. Ali will use techniques such as resampling ans boosting to make most of his models and the data.

One he designs and implements these algorithms Ali will evaluate thier performance and see hoe well the models predict data.
